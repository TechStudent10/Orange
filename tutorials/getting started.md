# Getting started with Orange
Orange is simple to setup.

## Step 1: Clone this repository
To clone it, first download Git using this link: https://git-scm.com/download. Next, clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TechStudent11/Orange
```

## Step 2: Running apps
I have provided an example file so I'll show you how to run. First, make sure you have Python installed. If you don't, go to https://python.org for steps on how to install.

Now that you have Python installed, to run an Orange app (or a `.or` file), run the following command:
```bash
python run.py <name-of-file>.or
```

So if you, for example, have a file named `test.or`, the command you will run will look like something like this:
```bash
python run.py test.or
```
