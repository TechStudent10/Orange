# Getting started with Orange
Orange is simple to setup.

## Step 1: Installation
You have two options for installation:
1. [Pre-compiled version](precompile.md)
2. [Compile it yourself](compile.md)

## Step 2: Running apps
I have provided an example file so I'll show you how to run it. First, make sure you have Python installed. If you don't, go to https://python.org for steps on how to install.

Now that you have Python installed, to run an Orange app (or a `.or` file), run the following command:
```bash
python run.py <name-of-file>.or
```

So if you, for example, have a file named `test.or`, the command you will run will look like something like this:
```bash
python run.py test.or
```
